# executable-zips

This folder contains StateMod executable zip-file installers downloaded from the OpenCDSS website.

The contents of this folder are gitignored other than this file.

The zip files are unzipped by TSTool command files into the `../executables` folder
and can then be copied into a model dataset `StateMod` folder as needed for testing.
