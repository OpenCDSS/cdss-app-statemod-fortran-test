# compare-statecu-runs

This folder contains TSTool template command files to compare two StateCU runs.

| **File** | **Description** |
| `compare-statecu-runs.tstool` | Command file to compare StateCU dataset variant run output. The file is copied to a dataset's `comps/variant1~variant2/` folder.  TSTool is run with command line options to specify the dataset folders so the template does not need to be modified from the original. |
